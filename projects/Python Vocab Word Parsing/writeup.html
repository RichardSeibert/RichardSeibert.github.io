I’ve been using this website Magoosh to study for the GRE. They have a flashcard study app for phones that lets you study vocabulary. The only problem is that the app organizes packs of vocabulary into groups of 50, and you are prompted to define random words form that pack that you haven’t learned yet. I personally don’t like this because I want to study smaller groups of words.

The good thing is that Magoosh published all the vocabulary words they use in this app… in a PDF file. I’m assuming they did this because they don’t want people to use flashcard applications other than their own. 

So, what am I trying to do here? I want to take all the Magoosh flashcard words and use them with a different flashcard app. I found that most flashcard sites allow you to upload your own file, like a CSV or other format, and turn it into flashcards. What I need to do is take this PDF and convert it into a text file with vocab words and definitions separated by a common character.

The first step was converting the PDF into something that I can work with. I used an online PDF converter tool that gave a .txt file output. Now I had a text file that I can use Python to clean up. Before that though, I noticed I could easily do some cleaning with just the find and replace function: Every page had a header of “gre.magoosh.com/flashcards”. There was also character that showed up before each one of these headers which was a little up-arrow symbol. I realized this was notepad’s way of displaying the control character for form feed (\f). There were headers that split the vocab words into three difficulty sections of “Common Words”, “Basic Words”, and “Advanced Words”, and every now and then after an example there was the statement “This word has other definitions but this is the most important one for the GRE”. I removed phrases in notepad.

After this I loaded it into Python character by character. There were a bunch of line feed, or newline, control characters in places the original PDF had them. I didn’t see this before in notepad because Windows uses CRLF (carriage return and line feed or \r\n) for a new line command. I also realized that because I as working with examples that used commas in them I had either had to replace all the commas with another character or find out a way I could have commas in a CSV. I decided to switch from commas to vertical lines to separate my variables.

After playing around in Python for a bit I realized there a lot of inconsistences in the text that made it hard to parse through the data. For example, after almost every vocab definition there is a new line and then the example begins. There are a few instances where there is a period after the definition is finished, which threw off my parsing. So I ended up making a sort-of FSM diagram on paper and then implementing it into Python, and I got it working.
